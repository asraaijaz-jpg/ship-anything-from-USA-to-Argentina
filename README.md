Shipping to Argentina - prohibited items 
 
You need to be familiar with the prohibited items list of any country you ship to. These vary widely but can be easily researched via their customs website. If you send something that is on the prohibited list, your package will be confiscated, and in some cases, you may be prosecuted. To avoid this headache, you should always do your homework and never just assume what is considered prohibited. 
For example, some countries have banned certain literature and some countries have even banned foreign calendars. The point is, you should never just assume that something has to be hazardous or dangerous to make it on the prohibited items list. A vast majority of some countries list consist of mostly politically banned items.
